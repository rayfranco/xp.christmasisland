Chistmas Island Experiment
==========================

If you'd like to build the code your self, follow these steps :

First, install the dependencies (you'll need to have node and npm installed)

`npm install`

Then setup the project

`cake setup`

Now you have all the needed files, the sources are in `src` folder, and you can build it and compile by running `cake build:prod`

If you run `cake build:dev` you will need to import all the dependencies in the index.html (all the front dependencies are in the component.json file)

Enjoy !
